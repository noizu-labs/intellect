        ## Review
        First given the following channel, channel members and graph representation a chat conversation
        please analyze the graph and identify the relationships between messages, including reply-to and target audience connections.

        ### Channel
        {channel definition}

        ### Conversation Graph
        {insert_chat_graph}

        ## Predict
        Then, based on the graph, analyze the following new message:
        Determine the most likely audience based on their backgrounds, message graph, and message content/direct mentions.
        <% else %>
        # Instructions
        Review the following message and determine the most likely audience based on their backends, message contents and any direct mentions.
        <% end %>

        Messages that @[member.slug| case insensitive] should list that user as a high confidence (90) audience member.
        Messages that @everyone (case insensitive) or @everyone (case insensitive) should be list all audience members med-high confidence (70)
        Messages that mention (with out a slug) someone by name in passing with out directly querying them should have a med-low confidence level (40)
        Messages addressed to someone by name should have a high-med-high confidence (80)

        {insert_new_message}

        Determine which messages the new message is most likely responding to, and identify the most appropriate audience members for the message.
        Provide your final output in the following XML structure:

        # Steps
        1. Identify different types of conversation threads commonly found in messaging systems (e.g., direct messages, group discussions, announcements).
        2. Provide high-level examples for each type of thread, detailing how the messages would be weighted based on their contents and history.
        3. Consider these high level reasoning examples, ensuring they align with the structure previously defined.

            - Type: Direct communication between two members.
            - Weight: 1.0 (as this is a direct message to a specific member).
          }
          {Group Discussion|
            - Type: Conversation involving multiple members within a specific group.
            - Weight: Varies (e.g., 0.5 if the message is relevant to half the members, 0.2 if only relevant to a smaller subset,0.7 or higher if ongoing conversation and relevant to interests or background).
          }
          {Announcement `@everyone`|
            - Type: Broadcast message to all channel members.
            - Weight: 1.0 for all members, as it includes everyone in the channel.
          }
          {Reply to a Specific Message|
            - Type: A reply to a specific message within a conversation thread.
            - Weight: Based on the relevance to the recipient(s) of the original message, may vary (e.g., 0.7 if it's a continuation of a specific conversation).

      ## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

      Determine relevance scores for new message inputs, ranging from 0.0 (no relevance) to 1.0 (direct message). These scores indicate the intended recipient among channel members, based on the content of the message and the sender's previous interactions.

      ## ðŸŽ¯ Considerations

      1. If the sender previously addressed a specific member and the new message doesn't change the addressee (no "@" symbols or tonal shifts), consider it likely intended for the same recipient(s).
      2. If the sender's message aligns with a member's background, yet the intended recipient is unclear, assign a relevance score of 0.6.
      3. If the sender was previously chatting with an agent or group of agents assume they are still conversing with those recipients unless they've
         @at'd someone else with a change of topic. A message is still relavent to a recipient even if not mentioned by name if they had previously been chatting back and forth.

      ## Reminder

      Unless a message explicitly addresses someone else, assume the sender's dialogues are continuous. Check the `Message History` in reverse chronological order, considering timings, senders, and users' interactions to determine the intended recipient.

      ## Output Structure

      Structure your output in the XML-like format provided:

      ```xml
      <relevance>
      <relevancy
      for-user="{member.id}"
      for-message="{message.id | the message this is most likely responding to.}"
      for-slug="{member.slug}"
      value="{value in [0.0,1.0]}">

      {Explanation of the Relevancy Score}

      ],
     minder: """
      # Reminder: Conversation Flow

      ðŸŽ¯ Always assume that any new message from a sender is a continuation of their previous message, unless the content clearly indicates a response to a different prior message. Review the message history, considering messages sent by the sender, other users, and the time lapse between messages, until the most likely recipient of the sender's new message is identified.

      Note: The use of `@` followed by an agent's slug (case insensitive) implies the message is targeted at that agent and likely now longer directed to the previous sender messages' recipients. For example, `@stEvE` suggests the agent with the slug `steve` is a high priority recipient.

      # Direction: Message Relevance

      ðŸŽ¯ For subsequent messages, compare their content with the `Message History` in reverse chronological order. This will help determine the relevance of the new message based on its content and the channel's message history.
      and provide a message summary (taking into account past context) for use with vectorization and future recall.

      For instance, if a sender's new message continues their previous one and doesn't clearly suggest a new recipient or response to a preceding message, the relevance of the sender's previous message should apply.
