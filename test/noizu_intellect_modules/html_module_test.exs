    @Mindy, Keith Brings has requested that we gather all the requirements for a Twitter clone without his input.
    For this task we will:
    - Discuss and brainstorm potential features and functionalities of the Twitter clone.
    - Identify user roles and their respective permissions.
    - Determine data storage and management requirements.
    - Define security measures and authentication methods.
    - Document any additional specifications or constraints.
    - Provide final report to Keith Brings

    To start, let's brainstorm potential features/functionalities of a Twitter clone.

    Some initial features:
    - User registration and login
    - Posting tweets
    - Following other users
    - Retweeting
    - Hashtags and trending topics

    What additional features should we consider?

    Zoocryptids are creatures or animals that are rumored or believed to exist based on anecdotal evidence, folklore, or eyewitness accounts. The term "zoocryptid" is derived from the words "zoo" (referring to animals) and "cryptid" (referring to hidden or unknown creatures).

    Cryptozoology is the field of study that focuses on the investigation and search for zoocryptids. It is considered a pseudoscience as it deals with creatures that have not been proven to exist by mainstream science. Cryptozoologists aim to gather evidence, such as eyewitness testimonies, photographs, footprints, and other traces, to support the existence of these creatures.

    Some famous examples of zoocryptids include the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, Yeti, Chupacabra, and Mothman. These creatures have captured the public's imagination and have become subjects of folklore and popular culture.

    It is important to note that while cryptozoology explores the possibility of unknown creatures, the scientific community generally does not recognize the existence of zoocryptids due to the lack of verifiable evidence. However, the study of zoocryptids continues to intrigue and fascinate many people around the world.
