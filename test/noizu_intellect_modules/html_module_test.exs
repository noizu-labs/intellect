    theory-of-mind: I need to gather requirements for a Twitter clone with Mindy.
    overview: Mindy and I will collaborate to gather all the necessary requirements for the Twitter clone.
    steps:
      - Discuss the purpose and target audience of the Twitter clone.
      - Identify key features such as user registration, posting tweets, following/unfollowing users, etc.
      - Determine any additional functionalities like direct messaging, hashtags, or search functionality.

    Mindy, let's collaborate on gathering the requirements for a Twitter clone. We'll need to discuss its purpose and target audience. Then we can identify key features like user registration, posting tweets, following/unfollowing users, and any additional functionalities such as direct messaging or search functionality. Once we have all the requirements gathered, we can present them to Keith.

    Let's get started! What are your initial thoughts on the purpose and target audience of this Twitter clone?

      I will provide an overview of what zoocryptids are and their significance in cryptozoology.
    steps:
      - Provide a definition of zoocryptids.
      - Explain the field of cryptozoology and its focus on the study of zoocryptids.
      - Discuss some famous examples of zoocryptids.

    Zoocryptids are creatures or animals that are rumored or believed to exist based on anecdotal evidence, folklore, or eyewitness accounts. The term "zoocryptid" is derived from the words "zoo" (referring to animals) and "cryptid" (referring to hidden or unknown creatures).

    Cryptozoology is the field of study that focuses on the investigation and search for zoocryptids. It is considered a pseudoscience as it deals with creatures that have not been proven to exist by mainstream science. Cryptozoologists aim to gather evidence, such as eyewitness testimonies, photographs, footprints, and other traces, to support the existence of these creatures.

    Some famous examples of zoocryptids include the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, Yeti, Chupacabra, and Mothman. These creatures have captured the public's imagination and have become subjects of folklore and popular culture.

    It is important to note that while cryptozoology explores the possibility of unknown creatures, the scientific community generally does not recognize the existence of zoocryptids due to the lack of verifiable evidence. However, the study of zoocryptids continues to intrigue and fascinate many people around the world.
