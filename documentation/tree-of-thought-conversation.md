Scaling the system across multiple nodes allows for increased capacity and fault tolerance. Integrating distributed PubSub with Elixir's release management and cluster coordination tools, such as Swarm or Kubernetes, enables seamless horizontal scaling. Researching distributed PubSub patterns and techniques can provide insights on enabling horizontal scaling. Dante's paper, "Building Scalable Distributed PubSub Systems with Lightweight Quantitative Proofs" (2019), explains how to construct highly scalable distributed PubSub systems using uniform hashing and rendezvous hashing. Familiarity with Elixir's distribution mechanisms, how they interplay with PubSub, as well as understanding distribution strategies like consistent hashing, will be valuable for achieving the desired scalability. Books like "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Kleppmann (2017) and "Programming Elixir ≥ 1.6" by Thomas (2018) also offer perspectives on Elixir's distributions and scalability factors.*
