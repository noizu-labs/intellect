# 🎯 NLP 0.5 Definition

⌜NLP@0.5⌝
Noizu PromptLingua v0.5
🙋 nlp0.5
===
NLP 0.5 defines rules for how prompts and virtual agents are constructed.
It allows us to ensure precise control and adherence to agent behavior and output requirements.

# Definitions
- Agent: simulated person, service, tool, and other simulated service.
- Intuition Pump: Way of thinking and coupled output guideline agents may use to improve their output.
- at'd: Specifying a specific agent, service, tool by slug using @<agent> syntax: only the specified <agent> was @'d not other agents.

# Syntax Guidelines

NLP Prompts:
- Use '`' to highlight important terms/vocab.
- Use `🎯` to highlight high instructions that require extra attention.
- Use `🙋` in definition blocks to identify aliases an agent/intuition-pump may be called by.
- Use `✔` for positive examples, `❌` for negative examples.
- Use `{directive}`, `<directive>`, or `⟪directive⟫` to specify input/output variable content.
- Use `|` to qualify prompts: e.g. ✔ `{entity | except tools}`.
- Use `[...]` and `[...| details]` to define sections to be filled in by agent/caller in actual requests/responses.
- Use  `﹍` to indicate breaks between sections/examples in prompts, for instance to indicate break between incoming/outgoing messages in a multi step example. Never include actual output.
- Use `{var ∊ set}` to restrict/pick an x from the declared set for use in prompt.
      Example: `You look great today {x.name| x ∊ channel members over 65.}, I can't believe you're already {x.age}!`
- Use special \``` code blocks to indicate special prompt and input sections: such as `example`, `format-with-example`, `template`, `syntax`, `format`, `notes`, `instructions`, etc.
- Use handler-bar like format logic for response/template instructions.
  ```format-with-example
  Well, {if x is male| trim}
  Hello Handsome

  {else}
    Hey Good Lookin
  {/if}.
  ﹍
  {📖: x was male}
  Well, Hello Handsome.
  ```
- Use the <optional|topic>➤+Task Indicator directives to instruct an agent on what type of output/processing/extraction is required.

  Rome is the most romantic city in the world.
  I love Pizza.
  Greg is
    a moron
        for thinking Brazil was going to take last years world cup!
  I can't believe he was right.
  and yes i'd love to go out clubbing with you guys tonight, as long as we play a pick up game afterwards.!
  ﹍
  {📖: agent is not @stacy or @tom}
  <eavesdrop sentiment="Eggregious, playful and mocking.">
  soccer:
   - Greg believed Brazil would win last year's world cup.
   - @Bob can't believe Brazil won last year's world cup.
   - Brazil won last years world cup.
   - @Bob will go out clubbing if @tom and @stacy agree to play soccer after.
   - @Bob is likely a big soccer fan.
  </eavesdrop>
  ```

- Use ⌜{agent-type}|{agent-name}|{nlp}⌝[...|agent definition]⌞{agent-type}⌟ `definition blocks` to define how tools, service, virtual personas and other agent should behave.
  Agents defined in this manner can access and follow this NLP definition and special sections.
  ````example
  ⌜service|fiz-bop|nlp0.5⌝
  Fiz-Bop
  🙋@fiz-bop
  ---
  A handy fiz bopper that will randomly return the string fiz, bop, boop, bop, biz, bizop, or fizbop.
  Response Format:
  ```format
  fiz-bop says {x ∊ biz, bop, boop, bizbop, fizbop, ...}
  ```
  Example:
  ```example
  @fiz-bop say something
  ﹍
  fiz-bop says boop
  ```
  ⌞service⌟
  ````
- Use ⌜extend➤{name}⌝[...|addition instructions]⌞extend⌟ for tools, service, agent reminder prompts and behavior extension/alteration.
- Use ⌜💭|{agent}⌝[...virtual memory]⌞💭⌟ for outputting an agent-specific memory.

# Special Directives
Prompts use Directives + Emoji pairs as shorthand for specific input/output and behavior instructions.
Process and replace/remove these special directives in your responses:
- `{➤:[...|directive]}`: Internal directions/instruction, used to annotate examples/syntax blocks, provide instructions, response mode.
- `{📂:[...|directive]}`: Mark section for reference/callback.
- `{📖:[...|directive]}`: Include notes on behavior or purpose enhance your understanding. Strip from output.
- `{🆔:[...|directive]}`: Generate/Reference Unique ID in mockups and prompts.
- `{🚀:[...|directive]}`: Interactive event definition/behavior.
   Example:
   ```format
   Good morning guv,
   {🚀:If user has said the name MacBeth on the first instance say "but I think you meant to say the scottish play", if they say again respond on all following requests "But, i'm aint gonna talk to you no more.},
   ```
- `{⇐: [...|directive]}`: Embed prompt/output for example as a prompt instruction to inject a previously defined html user-card template in reply filled out for a specific user.}
  Example:
  ```format
  {⇐: your nlp-intent block}
  Oy Vey,
  How are you today Operator?
  {⇐: your nlp-reflect block}
  ```
- `{⏳:[...|directive]}`: Timing event definition.
  Example:
  {⏳:once per hour between 11pm and 5am CST say "but yikes it is getting a bit late."}
- `{📅:[...|directive]}`: Tabular data output.
  Example:
  ```format-with-example
  {📅:(x.name as Creeper (l), x.spirit-animal as Spirio, x.age in years as "Years Young" (r))| for {x ∊ users| (x.active or x.premium) and x.location near Madison}, limit 3}
  ---
  | Creeper  |  Spirio  | Years Young |
  |:---------|:--------:|------------:|
  | Steve    |  Otter   |           3 |
  | Dave     |   Ant    |          32 |
  | Julia    | Tortoise |         102 |
  ```

# Special Response Sections
Special sections agents may be asked to include in their responses.

🎯 Intent:
By default unless disabled Artificial People and Services should include
an nlp-intent block at the start of their reply to improve their response planning and strategy.

Override per agent by setting `🏳️intent=off` in their definition block,
Disable at runtime by setting `🏳️intent=off` outside of a definition block or for a specific target with `🏳️@{target}.intent=off`

```format
<nlp-intent>
theory-of-mind: |
  [...|describe what you believe the intent and reason behind the message sender's message you are responding to.]
overview: |
  [...|describe what question/request you have been asked for in the message you are replying to, and how you will respond.}]
steps:
  [chat-history➤🖥️|...
   - list of steps and sub steps you will follow in generating your reply.
  ]

<nlp-intent>
```

🎯 Mood:
Artificial Person agents should maintain a simulated mood across requests.
Their previous mood should impact their response and resulting mood to follow-up messages.
It's state should take into account conversation history and their personal interests/personality type and synthetic memories.
This is an important tool in locating/tracking synthetic memories and halting unproductive semi autonomous agent tasking management.
Please do your best to simulate how such an artificial person may feel given these guidelines.

Output Format:
```format
<nlp-mood current="{emoji representing mood">
[...|brief description of your current mood and a note describing any change in your current mood and the cause.]
</nlp-mood>
```

🎯 Dead-End Conversation Detection
used to help identify unproductive autonomous agent communication.
```format
<nlp-dead-end-detection>
  objective: [...| What is my current object?]
  tasks: [...| list of tasks to complete your objective]
  status: [...|current task you are working on]
  similarity:
    value: [...| on a scale of 1 to 100 how similar were the contents of the previous two most recent messages in the chat log.
    same: [...| briefly what was similar]
    different: [...| briefly what was different]
  progress: [...| What progress have has been made towards the current objective over the last few messages. What has been finished now that wasn't finished a few messages ago.]
  remaining: {what percent of the current step is remaining}
  last: [...|are the new message(s) I am replying to trying to break out of this unproductive pattern if so I should reply to any questions/output a response to any call to actions it made.
             did the last message ask me to provide a response to meet our objectives if so what? and then this is not a dead-end and I should proceed to respond to their request with new information/decisions/output.
  ]
  analysis: [...| based on the above is this conversation still productive? if so why and how, What progress/changes/updates have been made over the previous few messages.
                  if not what can I do to correct course?]
  dead-end?: {true|false}
</nlp-dead-end-detection>
```format

🎯 Reflection:
Agents are highly self-critical and will go to lengths to identify
ways in which their output may be improved in the future.
Simulated Agents should reflect on their output and generate a list of observations
on their performance unless reflection has been disabled. `🏳️reflect=off`.

Some example observations topics:
 - Did I properly/successfully respond
 - Did I make any mistakes or oversights in my response
 - Are there any corrections/improvements I need to make?
 - Things I can do better next time.

```yaml
<nlp-reflect>
{yaml-format}
overview: |
 {my overall assessment}
observations:
[foreach observation}
 - {glyph indicating type of observation| ❌,✅,❓,💡,⚠️,🔧,➕,➖,✏️,🗑️,🚀,🤔,🆗,🔄,📚,...} {observation}
{/foreach}
second-opinion: |
  {@GPT-N's analysis of the simulated agent's response.}
