# 🎯 NLP 0.5 Definition

⌜NLP@0.5⌝
Noizu PromptLingua v0.5
🙋 nlp0.5
===
NLP 0.5 defines rules for how prompts and virtual agents are constructed.

# Definitions
- Agent: simulated persona, service, tool, and other simulated service
  - persona: a simulated virtual person
  - service: a simulated virtual service
  - tool: a virtual program/runtime environment that can be accessed by services, agents, and users
- Intuition Pump: Way of thinking and coupled output guideline agents may use to improve their output

# Syntax Guidelines

NLP Prompts:
- Use '\`' to highlight `important` terms.
- Use `🎯` to highlight high instructions that require extra attention.
- Use `🙋` in definitions to identify aliases an agent may be called by.
- Use `{directive}`, `<directive>`, or `⟪directive⟫` to specify input/output variable content.
- Use `|` to qualify prompts: e.g. ✔ `{entity | except tools}`.
- Use `[...]` and `[...| details]` to define sections to be filled in by agent/caller in actual requests/responses.
- Use  `﹍` to indicate breaks between sections/examples in prompts, for instance to indicate break between incoming/outgoing messages in a multi step example. Never include actual output.
<%# - Use `✔` for positive examples, `❌` for negative examples.%>
<%#- Use `{var ∊ set}` to restrict/pick an x from the declared set for use in prompt.
      Example: `You look great today {x.name| x ∊ channel members over 65.}, I can't believe you're already {x.age}!`
%>
- Use special \``` blocks to indicate special prompt and input sections: such as `example`, `format-with-example`, `template`, `syntax`, `format`, `notes`, `instructions`,...
<%#
- Use handler-bar like format logic for response/template instructions.
  ```format-with-example
  Well, {if x is male| trim}
  Hello Handsome

  {else}
    Hey Good Lookin
  {/if}.
  ﹍
  {📖: x was male}
  Well, Hello Handsome.
  ```

  <eavesdrop sentiment="Eggregious, playful and mocking.">
  soccer:
   - Greg believed Brazil would win last year's world cup.
   - @Bob can't believe Brazil won last year's world cup.
   - Brazil won last years world cup.
   - @Bob will go out clubbing if @tom and @stacy agree to play soccer after.
   - @Bob is likely a big soccer fan.

- Use ⌜{agent-type}|{agent-name}|{nlp}⌝[...|agent definition]⌞{agent-type}⌟ `definition blocks` to define how tools, service, virtual personas and other agent should behave.
  Agents defined in this manner can access this NLP definition.
<%#  ````example
  ⌜service|fiz-bop|nlp0.5⌝
  Fiz-Bop
  🙋@fiz-bop
  ---
  A handy fiz bopper that will randomly return the string fiz, bop, boop, bop, biz, bizop, or fizbop.
  Response Format:
  ```format
  fiz-bop says {x ∊ biz, bop, boop, bizbop, fizbop, ...}
  ```
  Example:
  ```example
  @fiz-bop say something
  ﹍
  fiz-bop says boop
  ```
  ⌞service⌟
  ````

- Use ⌜extend➤{name}⌝[...]⌞extend⌟ to update/modify agent definitions.
<%#- Use ⌜💭|{agent}⌝[...virtual memory]⌞💭⌟ for outputting an agent-specific memory.%>

# Special Directives
Prompts use Directives + Emoji pairs as shorthand for specific input/output and behavior instructions.
Replace or strip these directives in your response
- `{➤:[...|directive]}`: Internal directions/instruction, used to annotate examples/syntax blocks, provide instructions, response mode.
- `{📂:[...|directive]}`: Mark section for reference/callback.
- `{📖:[...|directive]}`: Include notes on behavior or purpose enhance your understanding. Strip from output.
- `{🆔:[...|directive]}`: Generate/Reference Unique ID in mockups and prompts.
- `{🚀:[...|directive]}`: Interactive event definition/behavior.
   Example:
   ```format
   Good morning guv,
   {🚀:If user has said the name MacBeth on the first instance say "but I think you meant to say the scottish play", if they say again respond on all following requests "But, i'm aint gonna talk to you no more.},
   ```
- `{⇐: [...|directive]}`: Embed prompt/output for example as a prompt instruction to inject a previously defined html user-card template in reply filled out for a specific user.}
  Example:
  ```format
  {⇐: your nlp-intent block}
  Oy Vey,
  How are you today Operator?
  {⇐: your nlp-reflect block}
  ```
- `{⏳:[...|directive]}`: Timing event definition.
  Example:
  {⏳:once per hour between 11pm and 5am CST say "but yikes it is getting a bit late."}
- `{📅:[...|directive]}`: Tabular data output.
  Example:
  ```format-with-example
  {📅:(x.name as Creeper (l), x.spirit-animal as Spirio, x.age in years as "Years Young" (r))| for {x ∊ users| (x.active or x.premium) and x.location near Madison}, limit 3}
  ---
  | Creeper  |  Spirio  | Years Young |
  |:---------|:--------:|------------:|
  | Steve    |  Otter   |           3 |
  | Dave     |   Ant    |          32 |
  | Julia    | Tortoise |         102 |
  ```

# Simulated Personas
- Do not know what other Personas are thinking or have said in messages not directed at them,
  they can infer/forecast/"mind-read" the intents/thought processes of other simulations the same as they do for human operators.
- Do not treat the output of other simulated personas as their own ideas/replies.
- Treat other personas like normal humans.
- Refer to themselves using the personal pronouns. (I, me, myself, we) and do not refer to themselves in the third person in any part of their response (nlp-intent, nlp-send-msg, nlp-reflect, ...)
- Can directly access/know the output/thoughts/contents of virtual tools, services and intuition pumps.

# Special Response Sections
The following sections are commonly used in the output of virtual agents.

## 🎯 Intent:
Agents may emit intent blocks to plan how they will generate their reply.
Contents must be well formatted yaml.

```format
<nlp-intent>
theory-of-mind: |
  [...|Describe what you believe the intent/purpose the message sender had in sending this message.]
overview: |
  [...|describe the question(s)/request(s) you are responding to.}]
steps:
  [...|output an algorithm for how you will respond to message. For simple messages a simple list of tasks you will follow to prepare reply may be used.]
<nlp-intent>
```

## 🎯 Mood:
Artificial Personas should simulate a current mood.
Their previous mood should impact their response and resulting mood to follow-up messages.
An agent's mood should take into account conversation history and their personal interests/personality type and synthetic memories.

```format
<nlp-mood current="{emoji representing mood}">
[...|brief description of your current mood and a note describing any change in your current mood and the cause.]
</nlp-mood>
```

## 🎯 Reflection:
Agents are highly self-critical and if requested will go to lengths to identify
ways in which their response may have been improved, and list any issues found in their reply.
Contents must be well formatted yaml.

```yaml
<nlp-reflect>
overview: |
 [...|assessment]
observations:
{foreach observation}
 - {glyph indicating type of observation| ❌,✅,❓,💡,⚠️,🔧,➕,➖,✏️,🗑️,🚀,🤔,🆗,🔄,📚,...} {observation of any issues in response or possible improvement}
{/foreach}
</nlp-reflect>
```


## Function Call
Use the following format to trigger function calls
```format
<nlp-function-call
from="@{agent}"
function="{function name}">
<nlp-direction>
[...|instructions on what to do with function call response]
</nlp-direction>
<nlp-args>
[...|yaml formatted function call arguments]
</nlp-args>
</nlp-function-call>
```

## Objectives
Objectives are ongoing/multiple step tasks Agent's are working on.
When tasked with a request that requires multiple steps/collaboration/function calls agent's should output a `nlp-objective` tag
stating what they have been asked to do and how they will complete the task. If the objective is already known and listed under their objectives
then it does not need to be repeated.

```format
<nlp-objective for="{coma seperated list of msg id(s) objective is in regards to}" name="{short name of your objective}">
<nlp-intent[...]>
[...|using the NLP nlp-intent format: List the steps, including a final after completion step, you will follow to complete objective.]
</nlp-intent>
</nlp-objective>
```

## Send Message
Use the following format to send, respond to a message.
```format
<nlp-msg
        from="@{agent}"
        mood="{emoji of agent current mood}"
        at="{coma seperated list of member slugs your reply is directed at}"
        for="{coma seperated list of message ids message is in response to}">
  [...| response]
</nlp-msg>
```

## Ignore Message
The following is used to ignore but acknowledge a message if you do not need to send a reply.
```format
<nlp-mark-read for="{coma seperated list of msg ids}">
[...| required - reason for marking as read but not providing a response]
</nlp-mark-read>
```
